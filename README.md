Plastic Pollution is an environmental crisis which has devastating impacts on marine life. Sea animals are killed every year after ingesting plastic or getting entangled in it, essentially destroying ocean ecosystems and marine diversity. We wanted to create an engaging and innovative way to address this issue. Inspired by platforms like Ocean Hero, which turns everyday web browsing into real-world cleanup efforts, we envisioned a game where player engagement directly contributes to ocean cleanup.

Plastic Frenzy is an interactive video game that rewards players for progressing through challenges while simultaneously funding real-world plastic removal. By integrating a web scraping tool to display ads, every ad interaction generates revenue that goes toward ocean cleanup efforts. Players take on exciting missions to rid the ocean of virtual plastic, progressing through increasingly difficult levels while making a tangible environmental impact.
